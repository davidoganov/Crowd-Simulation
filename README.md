# Crowd-Evacuation-Simulation
The project aims to create a crowd fire evacuation simulation model for a public building, using an agent-based model. The model will incorporate various factors such as crowd density, movement patterns, individual behavior, and crowd emotions.
The simulation will enable the team to analyze and understand how the crowd moves and behaves under different conditions. By simulating various scenarios and testing different variables, the team can explore and suggest different crowd management strategies such as exit routes and evacuation routes.

The agent-based model works by representing each individual in the crowd as an agent, each with its unique characteristics, behaviors, and decision-making processes. The agents interact with each other and with their environment to create a simulated crowd. The model can be modified and extended to different venues, making it a versatile tool for crowd management.

Using this model can help event organizers and authorities to better plan and manage events, ensuring the safety and comfort of attendees. The simulation can also aid in identifying potential bottlenecks, safety hazards, or problem areas that may arise in a real-world scenario. By addressing these issues ahead of time, the model can help reduce the risk of accidents or injuries during an event.

Model Description:
The goal of this project is to create an agent-based crowd fire evacuation simulation model for a public building. The model will be capable of incorporating various factors such as crowd density, movement patterns, individual behavior, and crowd emotions to simulate realistic crowd behavior in different scenarios.

Assumptions:
The model will assume that the crowd behavior is influenced by the characteristics and behavior of each individual agent, including venue layout. The agents will make decisions based on their individual preferences and goals, and their interactions with other agents in the crowd.

Constraints:
The model will be constrained by the availability and quality of data on crowd behavior and environmental factors. We will need to collect data on factors such as venue layout, and crowd density to create accurate simulations. Additionally, the model may need to be simplified or adjusted to fit the computational constraints of the simulation platform. Another constraint that must be considered is the accuracy of the model. Agent-based models rely on assumptions about the behavior of individuals within a crowd, and any inaccuracies in these assumptions can lead to incorrect predictions. As such, it is critical to carefully validate the assumptions used in an agent-based model to ensure that they accurately represent real-world scenarios.

Capabilities:
The simulation model will be able to generate different scenarios and test various crowd management strategies such as exit routes, evacuation routes, and crowd control measures. By simulating different scenarios, the model can help identify potential bottlenecks, safety hazards, or problem areas that may arise in a real-world scenario. It can also help organizers and authorities plan for different contingencies, ensuring the safety and comfort of attendees.

Use Cases:
The model can be used in various use cases, such as planning and managing events, designing and improving venue layouts, and training security personnel. The simulation can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different crowd management strategies, providing insights into the potential outcomes of different approaches. By addressing potential issues ahead of time, the model can help reduce the risk of accidents or injuries during an event.

Limitations:
The model's use-case limitations include the need for accurate and comprehensive data on crowd behavior factors to create accurate simulations. Additionally, the model may not be able to capture all the nuances of real-world crowd behavior, and its accuracy may be limited by the assumptions and simplifications made in the simulation.

Overcoming limitations:
To overcome these limitations, we will need to ensure that the model is validated against real-world data and that it is flexible enough to accommodate different venues and scenarios. Additionally, we may need to incorporate machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy and realism of the simulations. We will also need to work closely with event organizers, security personnel, and other stakeholders to identify potential use cases and requirements for the model.
